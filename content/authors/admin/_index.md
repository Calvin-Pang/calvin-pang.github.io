I am a PhD student in the Department of [Radiological Sciences](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/radiology) and the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) 
at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), where I am privileged to be co-advised by [Prof. Kyung Sung](http://kyungs.bol.ucla.edu/Site/Home.html) and [Prof. Robert Candler](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/robert-candler/).
Prior to joining UCLA, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2022, advised by [Prof. Yang Li](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37676384600). 
During my undergraduate studies, I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. Yuankai Huo](https://hrlblab.github.io/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://vanderbilt.edu/).  

As an active researcher in [medical AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare), 
I am a member of the [Sung Lab](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/sunglab/) within [MRRL Labs](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/), 
collaborating with [Dr. Kai Zhao](https://kaizhao.net/) and [Dr. Qi Miao](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/Qi_Miao). 
I also engage in collaborative research with [Dr. Wayne Brisbane](https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/wayne-brisbane)'s group. 
I work on using artificial intelligence and medical data to develop advanced medical imaging and diagnostic algorithms. 
My current research focuses on applying generative AI to medical image enhancement, including super-resolution, denoising, reformation, etc.

Outside of academia, I enjoy soccer, billiards, movies and musicals. I am a fan of [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/) and [Miami Heat](https://www.nba.com/heat). I am also a long-time player of [EA Sports FC](https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc).

:raised_hands: ***Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research projects or potential collaboration.***
