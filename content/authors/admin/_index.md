I am a PhD student in the Department of [Radiological Sciences](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/radiology) and the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), co-advised by [Prof Kyung Sung](http://kyungs.bol.ucla.edu/Site/Home.html) and [Prof Robert Candler](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/robert-candler/). Now I am a graduate student researcher in [Sung Lab](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/sunglab/) of [MRRL Labs](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/), working collaboratively with [Dr Kai Zhao](https://kaizhao.net/) and [Alex Hung](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~alexhung/). Before joining UCLA, I had been advised by Prof Yang Li in [emAI Lab](https://nju-ee.github.io/) at Nanjing University and Prof Yuankai Huo in [HRLB Lab](https://hrlblab.github.io/) at Vanderbilt Univerisity during my undergraduate studies.  

I am an active researcher in medical AI. My research interests are medical imaging, deep learning, etc. Specifically, I work on using artificial intelligence with medical data to develop advanced medical imaging and diagnostic algorithms. My research projects are currently focused on MRI image enhancement, such as super-resolution, denoising, and reconstruction. 

In my daily life, I like soccer, billiards, basketball and movies. I am a fan of [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/) and [Miami Heat](https://www.nba.com/heat).
