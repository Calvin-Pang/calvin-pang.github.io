I am a graduate student of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) as well as a research trainee of [Radiological Sciences](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/radiology) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) . I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.

I am an active researcher in medical AI. My research interests are mainly about medical image analysis, deep learning, etc. Specifically, I work on using artificial intelligence with medical data to develop trustworthy healthcare and diagnostic algorithms, which cover topics like medical image super-resolution, segmentation, classification, detection, etc. I have rich experience in different medical image modalities like MRI and histopathology. I had been under the guidance of Prof Yang Li in [emAI Lab](https://nju-ee.github.io/) at Nanjing University and Prof Yuankai Huo in [HRLB Lab](https://hrlblab.github.io/) at Vanderbilt Univerisity during my undergraduate studies. Now I am a graduate reseacher in [Sung Lab](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/sunglab/) of [MRRL Labs](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/) at UCLA. I work with [Dr Kai Zhao](https://kaizhao.net/) and [Prof Kyung Sung](http://kyungs.bol.ucla.edu/Site/Home.html).

I like soccer, billiards, basketball and movies. I am a fan of Arsenal and Miami Heat.
