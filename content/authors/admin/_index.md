I am a graduate student of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) as well as a research trainee advised by [Prof Kyung Sung](http://kyungs.bol.ucla.edu/Site/Home.html) in the Department of [Radiological Sciences](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/radiology) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I graduated from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.

I am an active researcher in medical AI. My research interests are mainly about medical imaging, deep learning, etc. Specifically, I work on using artificial intelligence with medical data to develop trustworthy healthcare and diagnostic algorithms. Now I am a graduate student reseacher in [Sung Lab](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/sunglab/) of [MRRL Labs](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/) at UCLA. I work with [Prof Kyung Sung](http://kyungs.bol.ucla.edu/Site/Home.html) and [Dr Kai Zhao](https://kaizhao.net/). I had been advised by Prof Yang Li in [emAI Lab](https://nju-ee.github.io/) at Nanjing University and Prof Yuankai Huo in [HRLB Lab](https://hrlblab.github.io/) at Vanderbilt Univerisity during my undergraduate studies. 

In my daily life, I like soccer, billiards, basketball and movies. I am a fan of [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/) and [Miami Heat](https://www.nba.com/heat).
