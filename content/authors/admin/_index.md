I am a PhD student in the Department of [Radiological Sciences](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/radiology) and the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), where I am privileged to be co-advised by [Prof. Kyung Sung](http://kyungs.bol.ucla.edu/Site/Home.html) and [Prof. Robert Candler](https://samueli.ucla.edu/people/robert-candler/). Prior to joining UCLA, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Science and Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) in 2022, under the guidance [Prof. Yang Li](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37676384600). During my undergraduate studies, I was also fortunate to work with [Prof. Yuankai Huo](https://hrlblab.github.io/) at [Vanderbilt Univerisity](https://vanderbilt.edu/).  

I am an active researcher in [medical AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare). I work as a graduate student researcher in [Sung Lab](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/sunglab/) of [MRRL Labs](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/), collaborating with [Dr. Kai Zhao](https://kaizhao.net/) and [Dr. Qi Miao](https://mrrl.ucla.edu/pages/Qi_Miao). I also engage in collaborative research with [Dr. Wayne Brisbane](https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/wayne-brisbane)'s group. My primary research interests are medical imaging and deep learning. Specifically, I work on using artificial intelligence and medical data to develop advanced medical imaging and diagnostic algorithms. My current research projects involve medical image enhancement, such as super-resolution, reformation, and denoising, as well as histopathology image analysis. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy sports and games like soccer, billiards, and table tennis. I am a fan of [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/) and [Miami Heat](https://www.nba.com/heat). I also have a wide interest in movies and musicals. 

***Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research projects or potential collaboration.***:sunglasses:
