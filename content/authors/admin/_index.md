Hi I am Kaifeng and you can also call me Calvin. Currently I am a graduate student of Electrical and Computer Engineering in UCLA. 

My research interests are mainly about biomedical image analysis, deep learning, computer vision, etc. I had been under the guidance of Prof Yang Li in [emAI Lab](https://nju-ee.github.io/),  Nanjing University and Prof Yuankai Huo in [HRLB Lab](https://hrlblab.github.io/), Vanderbilt Univerisity during my undergraduate studies. In general, I work on how to apply image analysis and artificial intelligence to human life to solve real problems. This is what I see as the ultimate goal of research.

I like soccer, billiards, basketball and movies.
I am a crazy fan of Arsenal and Miami Heat.
