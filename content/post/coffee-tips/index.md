One interesting thing about me is that I stopped drinking soda after coming to US in 2022. Since then, coffee has become an essential drink for me every day. In this post, I write down my favorite cafes (most of them are close to UCLA), and my 
personal recipes of coffee. Feel free to have a try and they will not let you down!

- Starbucks: Certainly, when you have no idea where to buy a cup of coffe, Starbucks is always a reliable fallback option. 
  + Latte: My favorite Latte recipt is **Iced Latte, less ice, oatmilk, 2 pumps of hazlenut syrup**
