One interesting thing about me is that I stopped drinking soda after coming to US in 2022. Since then, coffee has become an essential drink for me every day. In this post, I write down my favorite cafes (most of them are close to UCLA), and my 
personal recipes of coffee. Feel free to have a try and they will not let you down!

- Starbucks: Certainly, when you have no idea where to buy a cup of coffe, Starbucks is always a reliable fallback option. 
  + Latte: My favorite Latte recipt is **Iced/Hot Caff√® Latte, light ice, oatmilk, 2 pumps of hazelnut syrup**. I will say oatmilk and hazelnut syrup are a excellent couple! When the naturally mild and slightly sweet flavor of oatmilk meets the nutty essence of hazelnut, there will be an amazing slightly bitter taste in addition to the original bitterness of Coffee. (However, sometimes the hazelnut syrup is out of supply, the best alternative is **toffeenut**.)
